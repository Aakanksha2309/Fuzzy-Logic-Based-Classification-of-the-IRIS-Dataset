Handling mixed or overlapping classes in data classification is a common problem in pattern recognition. This letter presents a comprehensive fuzzy logic-based approach for clustering and classification of the IRIS data-set using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Fuzzy Supervised Classification (FSC), and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). The methodology involves estimating fuzzy parameters (mean-vector and variance-covariance matrix) from the training samples, with membership values derived through the FCM algo-rithm. These parameters are then used as centers and scale parameters for the radial basis functions in the RBFNN. The weight updating is performed analytically. Experiments are conducted on the IRIS dataset to compare the proposed fuzzy logic-based methods. The results demonstrate that the RBFNN, when combined with fuzzy clustering, achieves high classification accuracy on the IRIS dataset, confirming the effectiveness of fuzzy logic in handling uncertainty and overlapping classes.
